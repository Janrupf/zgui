//! Growing the frame's damage before a single fragment is emitted.
//!
//! Two rectangles reach the damage set from here, and neither of them can come from anywhere else.
//!
//! # The composites that read outside what they write
//!
//! A `backdrop-filter` samples the composite *beneath* it, and a `filter: blur()` samples its own
//! target, in both cases over a region dilated well past the rectangle being written. The scene
//! texture is kept between frames and only the damaged rectangles are cleared and redrawn, so
//! outside a damage rectangle those reads land on the previous frame's final composite — which
//! already contains the group's own output. For a backdrop that is a feedback loop: a caret-sized
//! damage rectangle inside a frosted panel reads sixty pixels of the frame before it, and the panel
//! smears a little further every frame until the whole thing is fog. For a content filter it is not
//! a loop but the same missing region: a target populated only inside the damage rectangle blurs to
//! a faded edge.
//!
//! [`expand`] closes that, and *where* it runs is the whole point. It walks the read-extent registry
//! and never the fragment tree, because the emit walk's constant-time subtree skip is over a union
//! of *ink*, and a read extent is deliberately not in that union — so an expansion folded into the
//! emit walk would be dropped at an ancestor in exactly the case it exists for: content animating
//! *under* an untouched blurred dialog, whose whole ancestor chain misses the damage. And it runs
//! before the emit walk, because a rectangle added afterwards is cleared by the renderer and
//! repainted by nobody, which is a hole rather than a smear.
//!
//! # The pixels a removed subtree left behind
//!
//! [`vacated`] is the other one. What compares this frame's output against last frame's only ever
//! sees output that still exists, so the area a removed panel occupied is nobody's ink and nothing
//! downstream can recover it. The roots a frame removed are read from the document — their geometry
//! outlives the change and is discarded at the frame's recycling pass — and their subtree ink is
//! absorbed while it is still there to read.

//! Two rectangles per fragment: what it paints, and what it reads.
//!
//! Nearly every fragment reads exactly what it paints, and the whole design leans on that: the few
//! that do not are registered while the fragment tree is built, so the damage expansion is a walk
//! over a handful of entries rather than over the document.
//!
//! The two callers of [`read_extent_of`] — the expansion that runs before anything is emitted, and
//! the cull that decides whether a fragment survives — are deliberately the same function. They have
//! to agree about which pixels a composite reads, and two implementations of one question is how two
//! callers come to disagree about it.

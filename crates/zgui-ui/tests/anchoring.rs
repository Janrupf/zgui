//! Where a floating list actually lands, in the numbers a person would recognise.
//!
//! Every surface in this library is placed by one component, and it is placed from measurements the
//! frame delivers: the trigger's box, the surface's own size, the window's rectangle. All three of
//! those arrive in **device** pixels, and the answer is written back as an inline `left` and `top`
//! — which a style sheet reads as **CSS** pixels. On the display nearly every fixture runs on those
//! two are the same number, so a confusion between them costs nothing and is invisible; on a denser
//! one it multiplies the surface's position by the density and opens a select's list below and to
//! the right of the whole card its trigger is on.
//!
//! So the fixtures here are asked at 1.25 device pixels per CSS pixel, and the question they ask is
//! the one somebody looking at the window asks: is the list's top edge against the bottom of the
//! control that opened it, and does its left edge line up with that control's?

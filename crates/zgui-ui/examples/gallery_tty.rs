//! The component gallery, on a bare Linux console.
//!
//! The same view the windowed gallery opens, through the console backend instead of a desktop —
//! the view is that example's own module, so what runs here cannot drift away from what is
//! shipped. That is the whole purpose: a component that behaves one way in a window and another
//! way on a console has a fault in the console backend, and one that misbehaves in both has a
//! fault in the framework.
//!
//! **This one needs the device.** Switch to a spare terminal, log in, and run:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p zgui-ui --release --example gallery_tty --features zgui/drm
//! ./target/release/examples/gallery_tty
//! ```
//!
//! It takes the keyboard away from everything else, so `Ctrl+C` raises no `SIGINT`. **Escape
//! leaves**, bound in a wrapper below for that reason: a console application that binds no way out
//! has to be killed from another terminal, and a kill runs no destructor, so the console is left in
//! graphics mode with its keyboard turned off.
//!
//! The window size the gallery asks for is what a desktop would open; a console has whatever the
//! display is and the request is ignored. The gallery is laid out for 1600 by 1000 CSS pixels, so
//! a smaller display shows part of it and scrolls the rest, which is itself worth looking at.

/// whichever menu, dialog or drawer is open. Binding it inside the shared component would take that
/// away from the windowed gallery.
///
/// It is `display: contents`, so it generates no box and the gallery lays out exactly as it does
/// under a desktop. What it contributes is a node to hang a window shortcut on — a key reaches a
/// window in which nothing has focus only through one of those.

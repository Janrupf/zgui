//! Runs a zgui application on a bare Linux console, with no display server under it.
//!
//! Layer L8: product. Experimental, and kept in this repository: the console stack under it is not
//! published.
//!
//! [`RunDrm::run_drm`] is the entry point. It takes the place of [`App::run`](zgui::App::run):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use zgui::prelude::*;
//! use zgui_console::RunDrm;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), zgui::Error> {
//! app().run_drm(|| view! { column() })
//! # }
//! ```

//! Allocating a buffer that a display scans out of and a graphics device draws into.
//!
//! The crate names no zgui crate and is usable on its own. It is written to be named by
//! `zgui-platform-drm` and `zgui-scanout`, one step along the same layer, and by nothing else.
//!
//! The kernel's dumb buffers are the obvious thing to reach for and they are the wrong thing. A
//! dumb buffer is *CPU-writable and scanout-capable*, which is not the same as renderable: a
//! graphics driver handed one as a render target puts it where its own engine wants it, another
//! device pins it somewhere else the moment it imports the descriptor, and the submission that
//! would draw into it is then refused — on nouveau, `kernel rejected pushbuf: Invalid argument`,
//! several calls after the point where anything could have reported the mistake.
//!
//! `gbm_bo_create` states both requirements where the driver can act on them, which is at
//! allocation. It is what every Wayland compositor allocates scanout buffers with.
//!
//! # Which layout, and why one card is different from two
//!
//! There are two ways to allocate: naming the layouts that are acceptable, or letting the driver
//! choose. The kernel's buffer-exchange documentation is firm that a chain must not mix them —
//! *"the complete chain of operations formed by the producer and all the consumers must be either
//! fully implicit or fully explicit"* — and [`Layout`] is which form one buffer takes. Every
//! consumer of a buffer is told what [`Allocation::modifier`] answers, so the chain stays whole
//! whichever form it is in.
//!
//! **An implicit layout is a layout only one driver knows.** It travels with the GEM object rather
//! than with the descriptor, so the allocator's own display engine scans the buffer out correctly
//! while a *second* driver that imports the descriptor is told nothing and reads it as linear. On
//! one card that is invisible, because there is no second driver. On two it puts a tiled buffer
//! under a linear renderer, and the picture comes out as a regular, patterned scramble of itself.
//! [`Layout::Linear`] is what a caller drawing across a device boundary asks for.
//!
//! # Loaded, never linked
//!
//! For the reason every other library here is: a console session has to start on a machine that
//! has none of them. A build needs neither the library nor its headers, and a display whose
//! machine has no `libgbm` falls back to copying each frame.

#![deny(missing_docs)]
// This crate is on the unsafe ledger's allowlist for one reason: libgbm is opened at run time and
// every call into it is a call through a pointer resolved here. A build that linked it would stop a
// console session starting on a machine that has no such library, which is the case the copied
// scanout path exists to answer.

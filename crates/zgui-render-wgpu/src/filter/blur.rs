/// is by definition insensitive to.
///
/// # Each pass writes only what the pass after it reads
///
/// The three do not cover the same rectangle. A pass along an axis reads its source [`reach`]
/// pixels away *along that axis alone*, so the one before it has to have written that much further
/// out — and only along that axis. Working back from `output`: the vertical pass writes it, the
/// horizontal pass writes it grown vertically, and the downsample writes it grown both ways. Every
/// one of those is cut to `valid`, because a read that leaves what the source holds is clamped to
/// its edge rather than left to whatever a previous lease put there.
///
/// That staging is the whole reason a blurred panel over a moving spinner costs the spinner's area
/// instead of the panel's. Giving `output` and `valid` the same rectangle collapses all three back
/// onto it, which is what a filter over its own isolated target wants: it reads only what it wrote.
///
/// The sampling lattice is anchored to the device origin throughout, so the result does not shift
/// when the blurred content moves by a fraction of a pixel — and, for the same reason, a pass
/// restricted to a sub-rectangle writes the same texels it would have written covering all of
/// `valid`.
///
/// Returns `None` when the pool could not lend the two scratch targets, which is the one case
/// where there is nothing to do but composite the content unfiltered.

//! The textures a frame's side tables are read out of.
//!
//! A side table is read at an index the instance carries — a clip, a paint, a ramp's stops, a
//! transform — so what it needs is random access from both shader stages. A storage buffer is the
//! obvious way to get that and it is not the portable one: storage buffers arrive in OpenGL 4.3 and
//! in OpenGL ES 3.1, so a GL 3.3 context has none, and neither does WebGL 2. On such a device
//! `create_bind_group_layout` refuses the layout outright and the renderer opens nothing at all.
//!
//! A texture read with `textureLoad` gives the same random access everywhere. The alternative was a
//! uniform block, which is faster still on some hardware and carries 64 KB at most — about a
//! thousand transforms, or seven hundred clips, and then a cliff in the middle of a frame. A table
//! this wide reaches 8192 rows before any device's limit, which is thirty-two megabytes a table and
//! past anything a document can produce.
//!
//! # What it costs
//!
//! Measured against a storage buffer over twenty thousand instances, with the per-fragment reads a
//! real frame makes: no difference on a discrete GPU, and about a fifth slower on a software
//! rasteriser. What pays for it is the draw order moving to a vertex attribute, which takes an
//! indirection out of the vertex stage — the fetch a tiled mobile GPU charges twice.

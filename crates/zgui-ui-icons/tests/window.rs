//! What a real window draws for an `<Icon/>`.
//!
//! Every other assertion about this component reads the document: the outline is on the element,
//! the square beside it, the class list right. All of them are satisfied by an icon that renders as
//! empty space, which is exactly the state a component gallery's icon card was found in — the
//! properties were written, the box was built, and no stage turned either into a primitive.
//!
//! So this drives the component the way an application does: through the umbrella, over the
//! headless platform, and asks the renderer what it was handed. It is deliberately the *component*
//! rather than the `<vector>` element under it, because the size of an icon comes from the sheet the
//! component installs — `--zui-icon-size` resolving through a second variable to a fallback — and a
//! box that resolved to nothing paints nothing however well the element works.

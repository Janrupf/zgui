//! The same buffers, on a machine that has no Vulkan.
//!
//! [`Imported`](super::Imported) creates its images through Vulkan and exports them. Neither half
//! of that exists on an OpenGL adapter, so this goes the other way round: [`gbm`](super::gbm)
//! allocates a buffer the display already owns, and EGL imports the descriptor as the texture a
//! frame is composed into. Nothing is read back and nothing is copied by the processor, which is
//! the whole point of both paths.
//!
//! # Which card allocates
//!
//! The display's own. That is the opposite of what a single-card machine would suggest and it is
//! what the hardware says: a buffer allocated on the card that *renders* is pinned somewhere else
//! the moment the display card imports the descriptor, and the submission that would draw into it
//! is refused several calls later. On a machine where the two are one card the question does not
//! arise, and this allocates from the only device there is.
//!
//! # Which layout, and the fault an implicit one hides
//!
//! [`gbm::Layout::Linear`], stated. A layout the allocator picks for itself is named to nobody: it
//! is a property of the GEM object, so it reaches the allocator's own display engine and does not
//! reach a *second* driver importing the descriptor, which is told nothing and reads the buffer as
//! linear. On this path the allocator is the display card and the renderer may be another card
//! entirely, and that is exactly the arrangement where the two disagree — the display scans a
//! tiled buffer out correctly while the renderer draws into it as though it were linear, and the
//! screen shows a regular, patterned scramble of the frame. Nothing reports it: every call
//! succeeds.
//!
//! Linear is what both ends agree on with nothing to negotiate. It gives up whatever a tiled
//! layout is worth on hardware that scans one out faster, which is worth less than a correct
//! picture. **The refinement is to negotiate** — `eglQueryDmaBufModifiersEXT` says which layouts
//! the renderer will import, the plane's `IN_FORMATS` says which the display can scan out, and the
//! intersection goes to `gbm_bo_create_with_modifiers`. That is what
//! [`modifier`](super::modifier) does for the Vulkan path, and it is the shape this one wants.
//!
//! # Nothing here is guaranteed by a capability
//!
//! The kernel's buffer-exchange documentation is explicit that agreeing a format and a layout is
//! not enough — *"having a non-empty intersection of supported modifiers does not guarantee that
//! import will succeed into all consumers; they may have constraints beyond those implied by
//! modifiers"*. So every step below reports rather than asserts, and a caller that cannot complete
//! the set falls back to copying each frame.
//!
//! # The image is destroyed at once
//!
//! `EGL_KHR_image_base` says destroying an `EGLImage` does not disturb the siblings already made
//! from it, and the texture is such a sibling. So the image is released as soon as it is bound,
//! and nothing here has to keep an EGL display alive to clean up after itself.

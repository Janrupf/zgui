//! Composing a frame straight into a buffer a display scans out of, on a machine with no Vulkan.
//!
//! The copied path reads a whole frame back to system memory and copies it into the display's
//! buffer. This is the path that does neither, built on OpenGL rather than on Vulkan: `libgbm`
//! allocates a buffer the display already owns, EGL imports the descriptor as a texture, and the
//! renderer composes into it where it lies.
//!
//! **The check is the buffer's own mapping, never the graphics API.** A copy into memory the device
//! cannot reach reports success, runs at an impossible speed and leaves the memory untouched; asking
//! GL what it drew answers with what it was told. Reading the allocation is the only question whose
//! answer cannot be a polite fiction.
//!
//! It needs no DRM master — nothing here sets a mode or flips — so it asserts on any machine with a
//! card, an OpenGL adapter and `libgbm`. A machine missing one of the three says so on standard
//! error and returns, the shape `cargo xtask ledger ignored` prescribes for a test that cannot be
//! switched off.

//! A copier that is a graphics context of its own, on the device the buffers live on.
//!
//! The context here is **not** the one the application renders with. It is opened on the display's
//! own node, holds nothing but the scanout buffers, and exists to move rectangles between them. On
//! a machine that renders on one card and displays on another that is the whole point: the
//! renderer's context is on the far side of the link, and a copy made there would cross the link
//! twice to save crossing it once.
//!
//! # What it asks of a driver
//!
//! Very little, and deliberately. A rectangle copy needs no shader, no depth buffer and no window:
//! `EGL_KHR_surfaceless_context` for the last of those, `EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import` and
//! `GL_OES_EGL_image` to reach the buffers, and one of two ways to move pixels. The machine this
//! was written for offers GL 2.1 on a chipset from 2005 and has all of it — which is worth stating,
//! because the same machine's driver is refused by wgpu, and that refusal is about GL 3.3 core
//! rather than about anything here.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! An EGL context is current on one thread at a time, and the application already holds one on the
//! rendering device. So this stays on the thread that made it, which a caller wants anyway: a
//! repair that runs on its own thread overlaps the frame being composed on the other card.

//! The bars a scrollport shows in the gutter it reserved.
//!
//! A scroll container that reserved a gutter has a strip of its padding box that its content was
//! moved out of. As in CSS, the strip is between the inner border edge and the padding: the bar
//! touches the border, and the padding stays on the content's side of the bar. Two things go
//! there. A *track* fills the whole strip whenever the gutter exists at all, and it is what catches
//! a press that pages the content. Its paint is the theme's to decide; the default paint draws
//! nothing there. A *thumb* sits on the track only when the content really can move, is as long as
//! the fraction of the scrollport that is visible, and sits where the scroll offset puts it.
//!
//! Every rectangle here is derived from numbers layout has already produced: the padding box, the
//! inner rectangle — the padding box less its padding — and the content box. The inner rectangle
//! and the content box differ by exactly the gutter. Deriving the thickness from their difference
//! rather than from the scrollbar width a second time keeps a track edge on the same number as
//! the edge it meets at a fractional scale, where two roundings of the same quantity part company
//! and leave a seam.

//! What a pass that only carried the rows after a grown one arrives at, against a pass that
//! composed every box.
//!
//! A row that grows moves every row after it by exactly its growth and changes nothing else about
//! them, so the pass carries those subtrees instead of composing them again. The two are only
//! interchangeable if they produce the same fragment tree, the same clip chains and the same hit
//! answers — so that is what is asserted, by driving the same growth over two identical documents
//! and taking one of them down each path.
